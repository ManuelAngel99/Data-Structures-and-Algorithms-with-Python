For strings k ~ $O(L)$ where L is the length of the longest string in the list, if the value of k is bounded, then we can drop the term as it is considered a constant.\n",
    "- **clear**: Removes all the items from the list. Time complexity ~ $O(1)$ (for algorithms analysis) or $O(n)$ (real life). If memory management is taken into account (realistic), the code iterates over all elements of the list and decreases their reference count, but since this depends on the implementation of the operation, GC related stuff etc.\n",
