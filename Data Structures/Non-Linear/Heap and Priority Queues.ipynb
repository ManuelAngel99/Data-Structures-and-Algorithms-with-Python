    "</figure>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap is a binary tree T that stores a collection of items at its positions and that satisfies two additional properties:\n",
    "- **Heap-Order Property**: In a heap T, for every position p other than the root, the key stored at p is greater than or equal to the key stored at p’s parent.\n",
    "- **Complete Binary Tree Property**: A heap T with height h is a complete binary tree if levels 0,1,2,...,h− 1 of T have the maximum number of nodes possible (namely, level i has 2i nodes, for 0 ≤ i ≤ h− 1) and the remaining nodes at level h reside in the leftmost possible positions at that level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "The heap provides a more efficient realization of a priority queue using\n",
    "a data structure, it allows us to perform both insertions and removals in logarithmic time, which is a significant improvement\n",
    "over the list-based implementations discussed above. The fundamental way the heap achieves this improvement is to use the structure of a binary tree to find a compromise between elements being entirely unsorted and perfectly sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why impose the heap order property?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of the heap-order property, the keys encountered on a path from the root to a leaf of T are in nondecreasing order. Also, a minimum key is always stored at the root of T.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why impose the complete property?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of efficiency, as will become clear later, we want the heap T to have as small a height as possible. We enforce this requirement by insisting that the heap T satisfy an additional structural property—it must be what we term complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap storing n elements has a height h given by:\n",
    "$$h = \\lfloor{log(n)}\\rfloor$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: The maximum number of elements that a tree of height h can store is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n = \\sum_{i=0}^{h-1}{2^i} = 2^h - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the statement above is equivalent to:\n",
    "$$h <= \\log{n} <= h +1$$\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n >= 2^{h} -1 + 1 = 2^{h}$$\n",
    "$$ n <= 2^{h+1} -1$$\n",
    "Which implies:\n",
    "$$  2^{h} <= n<= 2^{h+1} -1 <= 2^{h+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking logarighms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h <= \\log{n} <= \\log{2^{h+1}-1} <= h +1 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "## Inserting and element: Percolating up or bubbling up\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert an element into the heap, we first place it into the first available position that satisfies the structural property of the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that we still have a valid heap, we will need to update some of its nodes to make sure we verify the order property, we can do that by swapping the inserted node node with its parent repeatedly until the order property is restored. \n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this operation, is, in the worst case, $O(\\log(n))$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting an element: Percolating down or bubbling down\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete an element from the heap, we first do the following swap: The element at the top of the heap is put in the place of the element that needs to be deleted, the element at the rightmost position of the heap is put in the place of the element that needs to be removed. This way, the element is removed from the heap without breaking the structural property, but the order property is broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "To restore the order property, the element at the top of the heap (which previously was the one at the rightmost-bottom position) is replaced with either its right or left child (whichever has the lowest key) until the order property is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this operation, is, in the worst case, $O(\\log(n))$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using an array list to represent a heap\n",
    "\n",
    "The array-based representation of a binary tree is especially suitable for a complete binary tree T. In particular, we will use an array list with a None element stored at index 0. In that case, the following properties are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the i-th node:\n",
    "- The index of its parent is: $ parent = \\lfloor i/2 \\rfloor$\n",
    "- The index of its left child is: $ lchild = 2*i$\n",
    "- The index of its right child is $rchild = 2*i + 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional property that will be useful in the heapify algorithm is that all the leaves of the tree are located in the last $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ positions of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heap heapify: Building a heap in linear time\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a heap an element at a time has a worst case time coplexity of $n\\log(n)$. If we already know the elemens that make up the heap we can do better. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we start by initializing the heap array with the input elements. This way we are meeting the structural propery but not the order property. To fix the heap, we could either percolate up all the nodes in the tree, or we could percolate down all the non leave nodes (as percolating down the leaves does not do anything)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clearly more efficient to percolate down, since most of our leaves will be near the base of the tree and they will only need to move a few places, while percolating up requires most of the leaves to require almost the full depth of the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The worst case time complexity of this algorithm is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (n+1)/4 + 2(n+1)/8 + 3(n+1)/16 + ... = \\sum_{i=1}^{h} \\frac{(n+1)\\cdot i}{2\\cdot2^{i}} = \\frac{(n+1)}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{h} \\frac{i}{2^{i}}  <= (n+1)$$\n",
